*   **index.html:** The main HTML file of the website, likely serving as the homepage and potentially containing links to other pages (if any).
*   **styles.css:** Contains the CSS rules for styling the website's appearance (layout, colors, fonts, etc.).
*   **script.js:** Holds the JavaScript code responsible for any interactive elements, animations, or dynamic content manipulation on the client-side (browser).

## Functionality

Since this is a static website, the functionality is limited to what can be achieved with client-side technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript):

*   **Displaying Content:** The website displays information about travel destinations and packages, likely including text, images, and potentially embedded videos.
*   **Styling:** `styles.css` provides the visual presentation for the website.
*   **Client-Side Interactivity:** `script.js` might add interactive elements like image carousels, form validation, smooth scrolling, or other dynamic effects that don't require server-side processing.

**Possible Features (Limited by Static Nature):**

*   **Image Galleries/Carousels:** Displaying images of destinations in an interactive format.
*   **Contact Forms:**  Basic contact forms where the data is sent to an external service (since there's no backend to process it directly).
*   **Animations:** Using CSS or JavaScript to create visual effects and transitions.

## Setup and Installation

**Prerequisites:**

*   **Web Browser:** Any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

**Steps:**

1.  **Download/Clone:** Obtain the project files.
2.  **Open in Browser:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You don't need a web server to view a static website.

**Alternatively (Using a Local Web Server):**
If you have a local web server set up (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP), you can place the files in the server's root and then open your browser to the specified local address.

## Limitations of a Static Website

*   **No Dynamic Content:** The content is hardcoded in the HTML files. Updates require manually editing the files.
*   **No Database:** There's no database to store or retrieve data.
*   **No User Accounts:** User login and registration are not possible without a backend.
*   **Limited Functionality:** Complex features that require server-side processing (e.g., booking systems, payment processing) are not feasible.

## Further Development (Hypothetical)

To add more functionality, the website would need to be converted to a dynamic website by incorporating a backend language (like PHP, Python, Node.js) and a database.

## Disclaimer

This README is based on the assumption that the `travel-site` project is a purely static website. If there are any hidden server-side components or if the `index.html` file does include dynamic elements, this README would need to be revised accordingly.
